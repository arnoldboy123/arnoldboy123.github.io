      <p>I am a #codenewbie based in London, currently transitioning into the field of software engineering through a coding bootcamp. </p>
      <p>Prior to this, I was an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Pa5GXRgLc&t=194s&ab_channel=ArnoldHo" target="_blank">actuarial analyst</a> in the insurance industry. </p>
      <p>Basically my job was to make sure that Insurance companies have enough money set aside to pay their customers if <em>touch wood</em> something bad happens. </p>
      <p>I chanced upon this idea of a coding bootcamp through talking to a friend during a casual friday night dinner. </p>
      <p>Before that I have always thought that I need to do a 3 years CS degree in order to become hirable as a software engineer. </p>
      <p>Knowing that I am able to be a <em>functional</em> software engineer through the bootcamp route with much less time opened me to many paths I have not thought to be possible before.</p>
