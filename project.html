      This is the first contribution I have made on a GitHub open source project. My contribution was mainly on improving the link accessibilities on the site for people who are visiting the site on voice reader. This got me to understand more about website accessibilities as well as the general Git and GitHub workflow. I also learnt a lot about Jekyll as I got to read the source codes of the website.

      Since this is a coding tutorial website, by contributing to it I also have to read a lot of the tutorials. I learnt about creative coding through the javascript framework <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>. I am planning to contribute to this website whenever I have spare time.
