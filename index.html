      <p>I am a #codenewbie transitioning into the world of software engineering, my goal right now is to build cool stuff and figure out my groove through different side projects, including this site you're reading! I am currently doing the <a href="https://lewagon.com">Le Wagon London Web development bootcamp</a>, the bootcamp will cover full stack web development a heavy focus on Ruby on Rails. I also make <a href="https://dev.to/_arnoldho">my public notes</a> here on my DEV blog to share any tips and tricks that I find useful throughout my learning journey. Do hop along and join me on my journey to learn and grow together!</p>

      <h3 class="alert alert-warning">A list of goals in the future:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li class="text-success"><del>Make a personal site</del></li>
        <li>Making a pomodoro timer</li>
        <li>Cloning web apps like:</li>
        <ul>
