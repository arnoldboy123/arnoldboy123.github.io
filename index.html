      <p>I am a #codenewbie transitioning into the world of software engineering, my goal right now is to build cool stuff and figure out my groove through different side projects, including this site you're reading! I am currently trying to learn more about Vanilla Javascript before moving into more popular frameworks (such as React and friends). I am joining the <a href=lewagon.com>Le Wagon London Web development bootcamp</a> in October 2021, the bootcamp will cover front-end development with a heavy focus on Ruby on Rails. I also make <a href=https://dev.to/_arnoldho>my public notes</a> here on my DEV blog to share any tips and tricks that I find useful throughout my learning journey. Do hop along and join me on my journey to learn and grow together!</p>

      <h3 class="alert alert-warning">A list of goals in the future:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li class="text-success"><del>Make a personal site</del></li>
        <li>Making a pomodoro timer</li>
        <li>Cloning web apps like:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Linktree</li>
          <li>Netflix</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Contribute to a public framework on GitHub with Good FirstTime Issues</li>
        <li>Do a talk</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Online</li>
            <li>At a local meetup</li>
            <li>At a reputable conference</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>

      <p>Hopefully I will be able to cross off some of these goals soon!</p>
